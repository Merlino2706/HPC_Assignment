CORRECTED CODES
----------------
After the submission, we noticed that some of the uploaded codes were not the final versions, but rather preliminary ones used for debugging purposes. This folder contains the corrected versions of those files:

- 'heat_diffusion_a_omp.c"
- 'heat_diffusion_b_omp.c"

- "systolic_array_500.c"
- "systolic_array_1000.c"
- "systolic_array_2000.c"

It is important to note that THE OUTPUT FILES, RESULTS and the DATA ANALYSIS are BASED ON THESE VERSIONS.
